##### Sales_analysis-of-thousands-electrons-store

Just wrapped up a fascinating data analysis project using the power of Pandas in Python!



In this Task I use Python Pandas & Matplotlib to analyze and answer the business questions. I Delved into this fascinating dataset from a GitHub repository, and gave the answer of the business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.



I basically start by cleaning the data, this step includes dropping the NaN values, changing types of the columns etc. but before cleaning the data I do a main task related to combining the 12 months of separate dataset into one single excel workbook using Python Pandas.



Then after clearing the data, I jumped to the data exploration part, and have answered some of the Questions that was attached in the GitHub repository related to the best Product sold and which city has sold the most Product and many more and create the graph charts also.



Excited to share my journey in data analysis and continuosly learn in this dynamic field! Open to discussions, feedback, and connecting with fellow data enthusiasts. Let's elevate our data game together!
